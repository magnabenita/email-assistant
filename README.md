## 📡 API Endpoints

| Endpoint           | Method | Description                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`                | GET    | Root endpoint – health check                                        |
| `/predict-intent`  | POST   | Detects the intent (e.g., *request*, *complaint*) of the input text |
| `/suggest-email`   | POST   | Generates multiple polite email versions for a given user input     |
| `/analyze-dataset` | GET    | Returns basic dataset statistics (intent counts, etc.)              |

## 🔮 Future Extensions

- Integrate paraphrasing model to suggest alternate email drafts  
- Add authentication for multiple users  
- Deploy on cloud (AWS / GCP / Azure) for public access  
- Add endpoints for categorizing emails by intent (e.g., information, request, complaint)

## 🛠️ Notes for Contributors

- Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible  
- Maintain the structure inside `app/`  
- Use `app/services/email_service.py` for adding NLP models or extending search functionality  
- Add new endpoints to `app/routes.py` and include them in `main.py`  
- Update `requirements.txt` with any new dependencies
